GRB Light Curve Reconstruction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on the reconstruction of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves using deep learning models. By filling observational gaps and modeling the plateau phase, this approach enhances astrophysical analysis and supports cosmological applications.

ðŸš€ Overview
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the universe, often characterized by irregular and incomplete light curves. Reconstructing these curves is essential for understanding the physical mechanisms behind GRBs and for using them as cosmological probes.

This project explores three deep learning architectures:

Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)

Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)

Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU)

Each model is evaluated based on its performance in reconstructing the missing or sparse segments of GRB light curves obtained from Swift/UVOT data.
